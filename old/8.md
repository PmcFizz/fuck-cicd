## pipeline

流水线类型
* 基本流水线
* DAG流水线     使用场景
* 多项目流水线   使用场景
* 父子流水线     使用场景
* 合并请求流水线


流水线的触发
* 推送代码
* 定时触发
* url触发
* 手动触发



### 基本流水线
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

image: alpine

build_a:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job builds something quickly."

test_a:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This job builds something else slowly."

```

### DAG流水线
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

image: alpine

build_a:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job builds something quickly."

build_b:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job builds something else slowly."

test_a:
  stage: test
  needs: [build_a]
  script:
    - echo "This test job will start as soon as build_a finishes."
    - echo "It will not wait for build_b, or other jobs in the build stage, to finish."

test_b:
  stage: test
  needs: [build_b]
  script:
    - echo "This test job will start as soon as build_b finishes."
    - echo "It will not wait for other jobs in the build stage to finish."
  only:
    - merge_requests

deploy_a:
  stage: deploy
  needs: [test_a]
  script:
    - echo "Since build_a and test_a run quickly, this deploy job can run much earlier."
    - echo "It does not need to wait for build_b or test_b."

deploy_b:
  stage: deploy
  needs: [test_b]
  script:
    - echo "Since build_b and test_b run slowly, this deploy job will run much later."


```

### 父子流水线

父流水线
```yaml
stages:
  - triggers

trigger_a:
  stage: triggers
  trigger:
    include: a/.gitlab-ci.yml
  rules:
    - changes:
        - a/*

trigger_b:
  stage: triggers
  trigger:
    include: b/.gitlab-ci.yml
  rules:
    - changes:
        - b/*
```

子流水线

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

image: alpine

build_a:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job builds something."

test_a:
  stage: test
  needs: [build_a]
  script:
    - echo "This job tests something."

deploy_a:
  stage: deploy
  needs: [test_a]
  script:
    - echo "This job deploys something."

```


### 多项目流水线
```yaml
stages:
  - triggers
  - deploy

trigger_a:
  stage: triggers
  trigger:
    include: a/.gitlab-ci.yml
  rules:
    - changes:
        - a/*

trigger_b:
  stage: triggers
  trigger:
    include: b/.gitlab-ci.yml
  rules:
    - changes:
        - b/*

trigger_c:
  stage: deploy
  trigger:
    project: PmcFizz/other
    branch: master
    strategy: depend

```


### trigger token 

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -F token=a8e1063fddfcf81088687926fff5f0 \
     -F ref=master \

```

```yaml
  only:
    - merge_requests
```


```yml
.only-default: &only-default
  only:
    - master
    - merge_requests
    - tags
